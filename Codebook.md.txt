 The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.
 Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
 Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
 
 Following steps are done:
 1. Both train and test data sets are read and saved in R by using 'read.table' function.
 2. Both train and test data are joined using 'rbind' function.
 3. The mean and standard deviation measurements are only considered for each measurement by using "grep" function.
 4. The column names are changed appropriately according to descriptive variable names.
 5. A tidy data set is generated.
 6. Further the mean of each variable for each activity and each subject are calculated.
